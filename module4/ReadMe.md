## Linear Regression Model Summary Report

This report summarizes the key findings from the linear regression model trained on the Titanic dataset.

### Key Results and Performance Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** {{mse}}
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** {{rmse}}
- **R-squared (R²) on Training Set:** {{r2_train}}
- **R-squared (R²) on Testing Set:** {{r2}}
- **R-squared (R²) with Pclass and Fare features:** {{r2_subset}}

The MSE and RMSE values indicate the average magnitude of the errors in the model's predictions. The R² scores represent the proportion of the variance in the target variable ('Survived') that is predictable from the features.

### Overfitting/Underfitting Observation

Comparing the R² on the training set ({{r2_train}}) and the testing set ({{r2}}), we observe that the training R² is slightly lower than the testing R². This suggests that the model is not significantly overfitting the training data. However, the overall R² values are relatively low, indicating that the linear regression model might be underfitting the data or that a linear relationship is not the best fit for this dataset.

### Impact of Feature Selection

Experimenting with a subset of features ('Pclass' and 'Fare') resulted in a lower R² score ({{r2_subset}}) compared to using all features ({{r2}}). This indicates that removing other features in this case increased the bias of the model, making it less capable of explaining the variance in the target variable. The simpler model likely has lower variance but at the cost of increased bias.

### Recommendations for Improvement or Next Steps

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations for improving the model:

1.  **Try other regression models:** Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable. Exploring other regression algorithms like polynomial regression, support vector regression, or tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor) might yield better results if the relationship is non-linear.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from existing ones that might capture more complex relationships (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features).
3.  **More advanced feature selection:** Utilize more sophisticated feature selection techniques (e.g., recursive feature elimination, L1 regularization) to identify the most relevant features and potentially improve the bias-variance trade-off.
4.  **Hyperparameter tuning:** Optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen model using techniques like cross-validation and grid search to find the best model configuration.
5.  **Outlier detection and handling:** Investigate and handle outliers in the data, as they can significantly impact the performance of linear models.
6.  **Explore classification models:** Since the target variable 'Survived' is binary (0 or 1), treating this as a classification problem using models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or tree-based classifiers might be more appropriate and yield better predictive performance.
