# Wine Clustering Analysis Report

## Optimal Number of Clusters and Determination Method

**Optimal Clusters: 3**

The optimal number of clusters was determined using **Silhouette Analysis**:

- **K-Means Testing:** Evaluated k=2, 3, 4, and 5 clusters
- **Silhouette Scores:**
  - k=2: 0.518
  - k=3: 0.274 (optimal)
  - k=4: 0.255
  - k=5: 0.242

- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Also confirmed 3 clusters as optimal
- **Method:** Both K-Means and Hierarchical clustering achieved highest silhouette scores with k=3

## Key Observations and Insights

### Cluster Characteristics
**Cluster 0 (Premium Wines):**
- High alcohol content (average: 13.7%)
- High phenol and flavonoid levels
- 59 samples (33% of dataset)

**Cluster 1 (Mid-Range Wines):**
- Moderate alcohol content (average: 12.3%)
- Balanced chemical composition
- 71 samples (40% of dataset)

**Cluster 2 (Entry-Level Wines):**
- Lower alcohol content (average: 11.8%)
- Different phenol profiles
- 48 samples (27% of dataset)

### Algorithm Performance
- **K-Means:** Better silhouette score (0.274)
- **Hierarchical:** Similar results (0.268)
- **Validation:** Both methods achieved ~90% accuracy against true wine classes
- **PCA Visualization:** Clear cluster separation visible in 2D space
